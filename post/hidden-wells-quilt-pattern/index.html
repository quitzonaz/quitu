		<p><strong>Hidden Wells Quilt Pattern</strong>. So listen to you inner woman and take a chance. Jul 23 2019 Modified. Apr 5 2021 by Connie This post may contain affiliate links 8 Comments One of my favorite quilt blocks is the Hidden Wells block when made with 4 strips of fabric that are each cut 2½ by the width of the fabric. Your instructions are excellent and with my first small quilt Ill be able to figure out what size block I need and how to go about making them.</p>

The pattern is called Hidden Wells and was originally published by Mary Ellen Hopkins. After pulling a stack of fabrics from my stash determining the size blocks I wanted to cut from each strip set i started to sew. Ive made this block before in prints in different widths and different number of strips if youd like to. So I am working on a new quilt.</p>
